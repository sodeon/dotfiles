Optimizations:
	Enable/disable swap:
		Modify /etc/fstab:
			Comment out swap (following grabbed from Ubuntu 19.04)
			/swapfile                                 none            swap    sw              0       0
		sudo rm /swapfile
	Disable unused services:
		$sudo systemctl disable {service}
		services: cups, cups-browsed (bonjour printing), openvpn, vsftpd (ftp), snapd, snapd.seeded (snap packages)
    Boot optimization:
        Boot time analysis: 
            $systemd-analyze time/blame/plot; (plot will draw svg)
        Skip grub (save 2s): Set boot device in bios directly. Bios should see 2 ubuntu bootables: grub and ubuntu
		/etc/default/grub (sudo update-grub after editing)
			# Disable splash screen (doing so also disables plymouth service which does nothing but takes a long time)
			GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet"
			# Disable kernel messages on screen by outputing in non-existent tty
			GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=ttyS0"
    Reduce systemd journal memory consumption (which can sometimes takes hundreds of MBs):
        Disable kernel message:
			/etc/systemd/journald.conf
				ReadKMsg=no
            Can still non-archived copy from /var/log/syslog
        View jornal size: $sudo journalctl --disk-usage
