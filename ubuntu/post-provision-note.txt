Proprietary drivers:
    $sudo ubuntu-drivers install # Auto-detect and install (e.g. NVIDIA proprietary driver)

    Ubuntu already has ssh server and related ssh tools setup
    Copy ssh key to remote machine

Config:
    Check backup.sh and search for ".example" for config tuning

        dotfilesrc: profile used by backup.sh and restore.sh. REMEMBER TO RUN restore.sh AFTER CHANGING THIS
    ~/.config/hardware
