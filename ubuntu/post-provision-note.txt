Go to "optional" to install items useful for your system
Check backup.sh and search for ".example" for config tuning

Vim:
    open vim and :PlugInstall
    # copy ~/.vim to /c/Users/Andy

Tmux:
    (ctrl+e I) to download and install plugins

ssh:
    Ubuntu already has ssh server and related ssh tools setup
    Copy ssh key to Andy desktop
    $ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub andy@192.168.0.102

System:
    Remove snapd
        Find installed snap packages: $snap list
        Remove snap packages ("core" cannot be removed): $snap remove
        Remove snap: $apt purge snapd
        Re-install snap packages using apt: $apt install gnome-system-monitor gnome-logs gnome-characters gnome-calculator
    Power off HDD when idling:
        Go to gnome-disks' settings to do so. Not enabled by default.

System (Desktop):

System (Laptop):
    Modify close lid behavior: $sudo vim /etc/systemd/logind.conf
        HandleLidSwitch=suspend
        HandleLidSwitch=ignore
    Auto-mount network drives
        Modify /etc/fstab:
            sodeon@192.168.0.102:/ /mnt/andy-desktop fuse.sshfs noauto,x-systemd.automount,_netdev,users,IdentityFile=/home/andy/.ssh/id_rsa,allow_other,reconnect 0 0
        NOTE: If network drive is not always available, recommend not to auto-mount.
              If network drive is not available at the time of access, process hanged to wait timeout.
              Some commands like df implicitly accessed network drives.
    Wake-on-lan: very easy
        Step 1: Enable wake-on-lan on bios (Power On By PCIE). No additional software required. Ubuntu already has network driver support.
        Step 2: Trigger suspended system to wakeup (by sending magic packet)
            $sudo apt install wakeonlan
            $wakeonlan <mac address> # mac address can be found by "$ip a".
        Extra step: To debug, monitor if receiving magic packet
            $sudo apt install ngrep
            $ngrep '\xff{6}(.{6})\1{15}' -x port 9

Performance:
    Disable unused services:
        $sudo systemctl disable {service}
        services: cups, cups-browsed (bonjour printing), openvpn, vsftpd (ftp), snapd, snapd.seeded (snap packages)
    Boot optimization:
        - Boot time analysis: 
            $systemd-analyze time/blame/plot; (plot will draw svg)
        - Skip grub (save 2s): Set boot device in bios directly. Bios should see 2 ubuntu bootables: grub and ubuntu
        - /etc/default/grub (sudo update-grub after editing)
            # Disable splash screen (doing so also disables plymouth service which does nothing but takes a long time)
            GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet"
            # Disable kernel messages on screen by outputing in non-existent tty
            GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=ttyS0"
        - Risky (save 2s): $sudo systemctl mask NetworkManager-wait-online.service
    Reduce systemd journal memory consumption (which can sometimes takes hundreds of MBs):
        - Disable kernel message:
            /etc/systemd/journald.conf
                ReadKMsg=no
            Can still non-archived copy from /var/log/syslog
        - View jornal size: $sudo journalctl --disk-usage
