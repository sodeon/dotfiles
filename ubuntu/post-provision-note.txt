## Setup/plugins that needs additional steps after provisioning

Resolve dual boot time unsync issue:
    $timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 # https://itsfoss.com/wrong-time-dual-boot

Configs not backed up
    Start w/ i3: $toggle-window-manager
    Theme and icons: $lxappearnce

Vim plugin install:
    open vim and :PlugInstall

Tmux plugin install:
    (ctrl+e I) to download and install plugins
    During plugin installation, tmux will NOT tell you progress and shows nothing.

VSCode plugin install

## Setup/plugins that needs additional steps after provisioning (ONLY for new machine, old machine covered by "private-dotfiles" repository)

Proprietary drivers:
    $sudo ubuntu-drivers install # Auto-detect and install (e.g. NVIDIA proprietary driver)

Config (applicable if you do not have previous machine backup):
    Check backup.sh and search for ".example" for config tuning
    ~/.config/autohotkeyrc
    ~/.config/dotfiles/dotfilesrc: profile used by backup.sh and restore.sh. REMEMBER TO RUN restore.sh AFTER CHANGING THIS
    ~/.config/Xresources
        i3: config i3 settings
        profile: screen size
    ~/.config/i3/i3blocks
    ~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf
    ~/.config/record-screen.rc

System:
    Power off HDD when idling:
        Go to gnome-disks' settings to do so. Not enabled by default.

System (TV):
    Disable swapfile: 
        * Comment "/swapfile" line in "/etc/fstab"
        * After reboot: $sudo rm /swapfile
    Disable bootloader (grub):
        * Directly boot to linux kernel (EFISTUB): 
        * Skipping grub boot loader save 5 sec boot time when OS is on USB disk with Xeon E3-1231 v3
        * https://drak.li/linux/2017/11/12/efistub.html
        * Might be better, but not used. https://github.com/pbatard/efifs
    Decrease chrome I/O to improve USB flash endurance:
        * Youtube video will be stored in ~/.cache/chrome/Default/Cache; ~300KB/s for 1080p
        * Always (every 2sec) writing to profile in ~/.config/google-chrome/Default; ~50KB/s
        * $install-google-chrome-profile-sync.sh # in ./optional/tv
    Allow mnt accessible by user: sudo chown $USER:root /mnt
    Remove more packages: firefox, whoopsie libxcb1-dev (package used for building i3)
        mesa-vdpau-drivers:amd64
        mesa-vdpau-drivers:amd64
        mesa-vdpau-drivers:amd64
        mesa-va-drivers:amd64
        mesa-vulkan-drivers:i386
        mesa-vulkan-drivers:amd64
    Disable apt update
        $sudo systemctl mask apt-daily.timer
        $sudo systemctl mask apt-daily-upgrade.timer

System (Laptop):
    Modify close lid behavior: $sudo vim /etc/systemd/logind.conf
        HandleLidSwitch=suspend
        HandleLidSwitch=ignore
    Auto-mount network drives
        Modify /etc/fstab:
            sodeon@192.168.0.102:/ /mnt/andy-desktop fuse.sshfs noauto,x-systemd.automount,_netdev,users,IdentityFile=/home/andy/.ssh/id_rsa,allow_other,reconnect 0 0
        NOTE: If network drive is not always available, recommend not to auto-mount.
              If network drive is not available at the time of access, process hanged to wait timeout.
              Some commands like df implicitly accessed network drives.

Performance:
    Boot optimization:
        - Boot time analysis: 
            $systemd-analyze time/blame/plot; (plot will draw svg)
        - Skip grub (save 2s): Set boot device in bios directly. Bios should see 2 ubuntu bootables: grub and ubuntu
        - /etc/default/grub (sudo update-grub after editing)
            # Disable splash screen (doing so also disables plymouth service which does nothing but takes a long time)
            GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet"
            # Disable kernel messages on screen by outputing in non-existent tty
            GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=ttyS0"
